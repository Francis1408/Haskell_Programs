# Haskell_Programs

Programs that I developed in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) in order to have contact and practice with a functional language. You can check them out below:

1. Potency
2. SumOdds
3. Replace
4. Prime
5. Perfect
6. Binary
7. Distinct
8. Disjoint
9. Palindrome
10.sumPartials
11.Shift
12.Intercalate
13.Change

#### How to run

In order to run Haskell programs, you need to install [GHCI](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_in_5_steps) interpreter:

```console
$ sudo apto-get install haskell-platform -y
```

After it, run the following commands in your shell terminal:
```console
$ ghci <programfile.hs>

*Main> <filename> <input-arguments>
```
